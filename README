A collection of Ansible playbooks.

Some of this is a work in progress though most is working and useful.

Many playbooks depend on variables set in a hosts.yml, specified by -i per the example at the top of most of the playbooks.  

Create a hosts.yml with at least one host list:

[myhosts]
host1.fqdn
host2.fqdn

And depending on the playbook youâ€™ll need to define variables for myhosts:
[myhosts:var]
var1=value
var2=anothervalue

I will make a note to upload a sample hosts.yml

sometimes needed on remote hosts:
ssh -t host "sudo yum -y install python-simplejson"
ssh -t host "sudo yum -y install python-simplejson"
