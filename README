A collection of Ansible playbooks.

This is still experimental as I'm still learning Ansible though the update_*.yml scripts work well and are already showing their worth.  The install_custom_schema.yml is also a huge time saver.

Still works in progress are install_389.yml, prompting and zimbra  galsyncing.

sometimes needed on remote hosts:
ssh -t host "sudo yum -y install python-simplejson"
ssh -t host "sudo yum -y install python-simplejson"
